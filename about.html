        <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Sneha Agarwal</strong>, a dedicated and enthusiastic web developer with a strong passion for movies and digital creativity. 🎬 From a young age, I was captivated by both the world of cinema and the magic of the internet. Over time, this fascination evolved into a determination to learn how to build engaging, functional, and beautiful websites. 💻</p>

        <p>I’ve always believed in <em>learning by doing</em>, and that’s how my journey with web development began. I started with the basics of HTML and CSS, gradually advancing into JavaScript, responsive design, and API integration. Every project I take on is a new opportunity to improve my skills, solve problems, and create something meaningful. I love taking on challenges, paying attention to small design details, and making sure users have a smooth and enjoyable experience. ✨</p>

      <h3>About the Website</h3>
      <p><strong>The Movie Maze</strong> is a personal project that reflects both my love for movies and my commitment to improving my web development skills. 🍿 It’s a fully functional movie browser that allows users to explore the latest trending films, read short overviews, and discover new titles with the help of the <em>TMDb API</em>.</p>

      <p>This website was created using core web technologies like <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>. It features dynamic content loading, responsive layouts for different screen sizes, and color-coded ratings to enhance the viewing experience. 🎨</p>

      <p>The goal was to make it both visually appealing and easy to use for all kinds of users — whether you're a casual movie watcher or a die-hard cinema fan. By combining interactivity with clean design and real-time data, I aimed to create a simple but effective tool that makes movie discovery fun and engaging. 🚀</p>
